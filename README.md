Projects and General Descriptions: 

EECS 280 Computer Vision Project
Seam Carving Algorithm
Implemented seam carving algorithm to support content-aware image resizing through pixel adjustment 
Seam carving is a technique for content-aware resizing of images (sometimes known as “retargeting”). The end result is that we can resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio but does not distort the image.

EECS 280 Euchre
Euchre Project 
Worked in team to write a simulator for a game of Euchre, implementing both a computer-controlled and human-controlled player 
Euchre (pronounced “YOO-kur”) is a trick-taking card game popular in Michigan. It is most commonly played by four people in two partnerships with a deck of 24 cards

EECS 280 Post Classifier
Machine Learning 
Implemented program that uses NLP and ML techniques to automatically identify subjects of posts in forums 
Classifier used is a simplified version of a Multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier 

EECS 280 Office Hours Queue 
Web Server  
Worked in a team to build a small web server for an office hours queue, utilizing REST APIs to create a web application accessible through local browser

EECS 281 
Log Manager 
Implemented program to read developer log entries and create interactive mode to perform timestamp, category, and keyword searches for the purpose of constructing an "excerpt list" of the log file
Evaluated the runtime and storage tradeoffs for storing and accessing data contained in multiple data structures

EECS 281 
Zookeeper 
Implemented MST as well as Fast and Optimal TSP Algorithms 
Fast TSP algorithm does not produce optimal tour but solution is close to optimal 
Utilized nearest neighbor heuristic for TSP implementation 
Used branch and bound algorithm

EECS 281 
Space Station Game 
Created Space Station game where user is tasked with maneuvering through different levels and obstacles to reach hangar 
Developed two routing schemes to get from the starting location to the hangar location tile

EECS 281 
Zombie Game 
Developed a zombie game where player fends of various hordes of zombies (information about zombies given on standard input) 
Programmed behavior relating to shooting, zombie speed, zombie distance, player health, etc. 
Implemented sorted array priority queue, binary heap priority queue, pairing heap priority queue
